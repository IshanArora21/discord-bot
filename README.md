k so we gonna talk about how to run the bot on ur computer 

so install node.js (just google it)

once u have it
do npm init -y

in a terminal/command prompt whatever you'd like to call it

then u gotta install discord.js ofc 

so do 
npm install discord.js

yay almost done!

now u just need to start the bot
so this project's is index so im assuming urs is probably the same so do
node index.js

it should log a message in the console and boom! u have started the bot


NOTE: you will need to get a bot token, i will put it in this repo but i need to make it private first (the bot token will go in config.json where it says insert bot token here)
